## 🧠 Project Overview
The **Inventory Analysis System** is a **console-based mini project** developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It automates inventory management for small and medium-sized retail businesses, allowing users to record, analyze, and monitor stock details with accuracy and efficiency.

This project demonstrates core OOP concepts such as **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction**, along with **file handling** for data persistence and **STL containers** for dynamic memory management.

## 🎯 Features
- ➕ Add, view, and delete product records  
- 🍎 Manage both **regular** and **perishable** products using inheritance  
- 💰 Calculate **profit or loss** automatically  
- 📉 Detect **low-stock** or **high-demand** items  
- 💾 Store product data permanently using **file handling**  
- 🧮 Generate analytical reports for decision-making

## 🧩 Object-Oriented Concepts Implemented
| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Protects product data through private members and public methods |
| **Inheritance** | Extends the Product class to create a PerishableProduct subclass |
| **Polymorphism** | Uses virtual functions for dynamic behavior |
| **Abstraction** | Simplifies reporting and analysis logic |
| **File Handling** | Saves and retrieves product data permanently |
| **STL (Vector)** | Efficiently stores dynamic lists of product objects |
